## Project Proposal

**Chosen Track:** Password Manager

### Description

I will secure the data by using a strong encryption method. If possible, I would also implement using 2FA to access the passwords.
### Planned Features

- Registration with master password and 2FA
- Adding passwords and linking them to websites/apps
- Logging in to see the passwords

### Stretch Goals

In the future, I want to add a feature that can auto-detect when passwords are updated and update them in the password manager.
